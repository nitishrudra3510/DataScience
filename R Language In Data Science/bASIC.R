# BASICS SYNTAX in R Programming.
A = "HELLO WORLD"
print(A)

# VARIABLE In R:
"
1. = (Simple Assignment)
2. <- (Leftward Assignemnt)
3. -> (Rightward Assignemnt).

"

var1 <- "Simple Assignment"

var2 <- "Right Assignment"

"Right Assignment" -> var3

print(var1)
print(var2)
print(var3)



#comments:

# -> #single line comments.
"" -> "multiple line comments."
# (# is not symbol of comments of documentation comments)Documentation Comments- Comments that are drafted usually for a quick documentation lookup

"Comments are generally used for the following purposes:
1. Code Readability
2. Explanation of the code or Metadata of the project
3. Prevent execution of code
4. To include resources
"
"
Note: R doesn’t support Multi-line and Documentation comments. 
It only supports single-line comments drafted by a ‘#’ symbol.
"
#Multi-line line:
"
As stated earlier that R doesn’t support multi-lined comments, but to make the 
commenting process easier, R allows commenting on multiple single lines at once. There are two ways to add multiple single-line comments in R Studio:

First way: Select the multiple lines on which you want to comment using
the cursor and then use the key combination “control + shift + C” to comment or uncomment the selected lines.


Second way: The other way is to use the GUI, select the lines on which you want to
comment by using the cursor and click on “Code” in the menu, a pop-up window pops out in
which we need to select “Comment/Uncomment Lines” which appropriately comments or uncomment the lines which you have selected.
