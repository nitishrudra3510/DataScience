# python is  case sensitive language and which means that uppercase and lowercase letter are treateds differented. eg. Name, name both are different varibles.


# single line comment : # to avoid the interpreter at excuting time and helps to undestand the code.


#'If', 'otherwise', 'for', 'while', 'try', 'except', and 'finally' are a few reserved keywords in Python that cannot be used as variable names.
#These terms are used in the language for particular reasons and have fixed meanings. 



# Here are some key points from the history of Python:

# 1. **Creation and Early Development**:
#    - Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language.
#    - Python 0.9.0 was released in February 1991 as the first public version.

# 2. **Python 1.0**:
#    - Released in January 1994, it marked a stable and usable version of the language.
#    - Many features from this version are still present in Python today.

# 3. **Python 2.0**:
#    - Released in October 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions, garbage collection, and Unicode support.

# 4. **Python 3.0**:
#    - Released in December 2008 with backward-incompatible changes focusing on code readability and maintainability.

# 5. **Popularity Surge**:
#    - Python gained popularity in the 1990s and 2000s for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.
#    - Became widely used in data science, machine learning, and web development throughout the 2010s.

# 6. **Python Software Foundation**:

# python data structure

Python offers four built-in data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries that allow us to store data in an efficient way.

# 1. Lists:

Lists are ordered collections of data elements of different data types.
Lists are mutable meaning a list can be modified anytime.
Elements can be accessed using indices.
They are defined using square bracket '[]'.




# code:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange' ]
print("Fruits 1 : ", fruits[1])

# Modify list  
fruits.append('guava')  
print("fruits =", fruits)  


# list numbers sum.

num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

# calcualte sum
sum_nums = sum(num_list)
print("sum numbers : ", sum_nums)
